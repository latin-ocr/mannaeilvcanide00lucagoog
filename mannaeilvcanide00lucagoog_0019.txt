There appear good grounds for believing that one, and perhaps
the chief, of these was thenow lost history of Livy. More than
oue incident, of which Lucan is now the earliest witness, is
said to have been recorded in Livy, eg. that of the Augur
Cornelius1. A predecessor of Lucan, Valerius Maximus, the
industrious collector of anecdotos, used Livy and refers to
him; and there are some striking agreements between Lucan
, and Valerius Maximus². A succeeding historian, L. Annaeus
Florus, drew chiefly from ¹Livy³3 and Lucan and Florus are
often in the closest agreementt Lucan again must have
been naturally drawn to a writer whose treatment of the
aristocrats was so ‘Pompeian⁶.' Nor is it superfluous to
observe that'the frequency with which Livy may he used for
the¹ illustration of Lucan's phraseology points of itself to the
same conclusion⁶. '

So far as 1 know, no evidence is forthcoming that Lucan did
actually draw from any other source. There is nothing to show
that he used the lost history of Asinius Pollio, and if within the

present book he made any use of the narrative of Caesar, it was
certainly only for the purpose of contradicting it.

⁴ It has been sought to explain these agreements by the hypothesis
that Florus copied Lucan. That Florus had read the ‘Civil War,’
that for ideas and expressions he is often indebted to its author, may
well be admitted. But to suppose thatin questions of fact· the epito-
mator of a history would abandon its statements for those of a poem
written more than a century after the events is an imputation of
incompetence not admissible without the strictest proof. Τὴε same
may he said of Appian.
