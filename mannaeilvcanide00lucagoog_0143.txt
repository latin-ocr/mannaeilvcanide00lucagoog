eoa-³. 1 am glad to find myself to a certain extent in agreement
with C. M. Francken Mnemosyne (n. series), vol. uz p. 166, who reads
‘inde manus spectant uoltusque ac noscere quaerunt,' comparing sor the
corruption 11 ¹93 where M reads ac noscendus for agnoscendus. He

places 462 before 463, in which he reads ‘quo sua pila cadant et quae .

sibi lata minentur.’ The sense thus obtained is avery fair one: but it
may be doubted whether the ns variants can be thus explained ; and
the preponderance of evidence, as already said, is in favour of a different
order ol lines.
