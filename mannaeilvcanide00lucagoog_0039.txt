and tears in their eyeS, they begged their lives oi the conqueror.
In some reassuring words Caesar bade them rise, and, aster
a brief address in which he referred to his own clemency the
more effectually to remove their sear, he spared the lives of all,
and gave instructions to his own troops that no one of thern was
to be hanned or his property touched.

Thus ended the battle os Pharsalia. The loss oi the victors
was small Ol tho rank and file only 200fe111, but os the
centurions as many as 30, a proof how gallantly they exposed
themselves. Amongst those killed was the heroic Crastinus,
who had fallen from a sword·thrust in the face at the very
beginning of the engagement². He had kept his promise to
his commander, as Caesar gratefully records. Search was made
t'or his corpse amongst the slain. It was invested with military
decorations and interred apart from the rest³. Of the Pom-
peians 15,ooo fell, while 24,ooo surrendered, and a great many
made good their escape into the towns in the neighbourhood⁴.
Amongst the killed were ten senators and forty equites, one
of the former being Domitius Ahenobarbus, who was cut down
by the cavalry under the command os Mark Antony when
flyin'g from the camp⁶. These heavy losses were all sustained
in' the battle, the storming of the camp, and the puisuit: sor

¹ According to Appian (c. 8a): some authorities said 1‚200‚ which
would remove the disproportionate loss of officers upon which Caesar
remarks. ’

² ‘Gladio in os aduersum coniecto‚’ Caes, ὑποστάς τις ὠθεῖ διὰ τοῦ
στόματος τὸ ξίφος ὥστε τὴν αἰχμὴν ἀνασχεῖν κατὰ τὸ ίνίον (the nape ol the
neck) Plut. Pomp. 71, cf. Caes. 44. ’

³ See Appian c. 82 fin. ἔξω τοῦ πολυανδρίου, ‘outside the general
burying-place.' These details are not mentioned by Caesar.

‘This is Caesar's statement. Asinius Pollio, who served under
Caesar in the battle, put the Pompeian loss as 6000, according to
Plut. Porrtp. 72 and Appian c. 82. These statements may be reconciled'
(as they are by Col. Stoffel) by supposing that 6,000 was the loss of the
legionaries. Some raised the number to 25,000, which Appian saus‘xs

an exaggeration.
