night, with a small following of thirty horsemen who had fled to
the same place, he pursued his flight through the vale of Tempe,
till at last he reached the coast and, taking ship in a corn
transport for Lesbos, put the sea between himself and Pharsalia
All the way, we are told, he bewailed the great miscalculation,
and his almost treacherous desertion by the very troops on
whom he had leaned for victoryl. ,

The spectacle which met the eyes of Caesar· and his as·
tonished soldiers upon their entrance was such as had never
been seen before in a Roman camp. There were leafy arbours
for dining intents floored with fresh cut turf, others screened
with ivy to protect ‚theru from the sun, orwreathed with branches
of bay, vast quantities of silver plate set out with other prepara·
tions for the feast that· was to celebrate the Pompeian victory,

that precedes a sant Caesar has recorded his own feelings ol
not unnatural indignation. ‘Such were the men’ he writes
‘who charged with sels-indulgence Caesar’s most wretched and
long-suffering army, which had always been in want of every·

lend no support to Lucan's highly coloured picture of tlre fidelity of
Larisa. It must not however be supposed to be a pure invention of the
poet’s. The agreement of Valerius Maximus (lc. 712 n), even to verbal
concurrence, and in the main os Dio (42. 2), indicates a common source.

¹ Caesar l.c. sup. Plutarch, Pomp. 73, adds a number of interesting
personal details about the flight. Lucan's brilliant analysis of the
fugitive's feelings deserves to be mentioned (vui 1 sqq.). In vr1,his
hero once off the scene, the poet parts company with history and devotes
himself to the congenial taslrs of slandering Caesar and rudungum
a ghoul‚ among the-spectres and carcases ol the slain.
