arysqq. All our authorities (Caesar B. C. 3. 88, Plutarch Parim.
69, Appian 4. 76) agree that Scipio commanded the Pompeian centre.
But they disagree about the wings. Plutarch says Pompey commanded
on the right but Appian Lentulus; they agree in placing Domitius on
the left. Appian says Pompey with Afranius τὸ στρατόπεδον ἐφύλαττεν,
which may be true ol Afranius, but iu the case of Pompey is un·
doubtedly an error, due perhaps to his early retirement to the camp.
Caesar does not expressly say who commanded the wings but notes
that Pompey was ou the leit, ‘in eo loco erat ipse Pompeius.’ All
Ι we can conclude with certainty is that Domitius commanded one wing,
and Pompey—in his absence, Lentulus—the other. Which these
were must be doubtful.
