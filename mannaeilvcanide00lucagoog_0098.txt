³ them (318sq.) but to slaughter the auxiliaries (275 sqq.) in order to
inspire the Romans with terror. Ι have however changed tlre punctua-
tion (cl. Crit. App.) because 323 sqq. refer'to Romans and so belong
to 32²· lt is absurd to say ‘whether he is going to attack ·a ldnsman
or not, let him count the killing ol an alien enemya crime.’ Mistake
has arisen through its not being observed that elue-seu as usual, cf. 19,
197 n., follow the clause to which they reler and that Lucan having

used the indefinite quis does not go back to tlre second person, imputate
as it would be, but continues with the metrically convenient third.

ignoti ‘foreign ’ς so in 1 169 sq. ‘antiquos Curiorum passa ligones l
longa sub agnatis extendere rura colonis! luculum ‘the killing‚'

326 sqq. Here again Lucan and upplan (a. 74 καθέλετέ μοι προιόντες
ἐπὶ τὴν μάχην τὰ τείχη τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν τάφρον έγῆηώσοτε)
are in striking agreement, no one else mentioning this order ol Caesar.
Their account is contradicted by Caesar‘s own statement 3. 89 ‘cohortes
vtt (ιι tiss) castris praesidio reliquerat’3 and it is, as Mr B. Perrin
American Journ. os Philology vol. v pp. 32 5 sqq, liasv shown, most im·
probable. Appian, he thinks, derived it srom Lucan. Cl. Introd.
p. xxvi n.

327. plenta ‘with their tale of maniplos complete,' cl. Virg. Aen.
7. 53 ‘plenis iam nubilis annis’ (of full age). Appi'an gives different
reasons lor the order, ol which one is quoted below. non spuria,
ie. in a solid array; cl. x 436 (on 337 below).

⁴328. no, Crit. App. caetris ‘quartem’ practically=tewtoriis‚
cl. tendetis &o tendetis The regular word lor encamping,
not avoided by poets, For the sense cs. Appian l. c. iva..,oi πολέμιοι...

soldier's duty draws him mechanically. ruptim, so Caesar c. 85

‘ueteribus saeculis mos luit parco cibo curatos milites ad certarnen
educere,’ cl. Val. Fl. 5. ²¹5 sq. ‘dona dehinc Bacchi casusque ut firmet
in omnes l rapta Ceres? But the hardened veterans ol Caesar, who had
not long had a meal-they were on the point ol setting out as Caesar
says l. c., the signal had0been given lor departure and the tents were
struck (detensis tabernaculis, which by the way may have given rise to
the story of the dismantling ol the camp)-would hardly have wanted a
second relreslrmeut. capiunt, i.e. the omen in Caesar‘s last words;
