SOME PRESS NOTICES.

⁴⁶ It is greatly to be wished that more critical work of the kind
were achieved in England.”—Athenaeum.

“Dr Postgate’s work is as elever as it is painstaking.''-E. J. WEBB
in Classical Review.

“Tm work is a brilliant contribution to the textos Manilius, and
‘in many cases one is tempted to ask why so simple and probable an
emendation has never occurred to any critic before.”- The Notion

(New York).

“The author has made no inconsiderable contribution to the
criticism and textual restoration ol one ol the most difficult Latin
poets.”—J01{.TOL1<11c1m in Wochenschnstfar K lassiscke Philologic.

“The impression which the conjectures leave upon the reviewer
is that they are well judged and in many cases hit the mark, thus
substantially promoting our understanding of the poet....An appendix
and indices form the conclusion to the book whose excellent get-up
deserves especial mention.’'—CRAMER in Neue PhilologischeRundschau.
