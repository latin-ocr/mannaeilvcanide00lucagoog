CRITICAL' APPENDIX. 97

abscindo, rescindo, interscindo are all used ol opening veins, and the
emendation is supported by the passage of Ovid quoted ad loc. which
Lucan appears to have iu mind t ‘transmittarit’ in the previous line may
have induced the corruption. ⁶41 Hosius reads uincimur with
V, and seruiat with MBEV. But see Mr Heitland (Cl. Rev. rx
p. 197). quae seruiat ‘to be slaves’ may however possibly be
right. 643 pauidi EUG several edd, but the adv. is clearly right.
6⁶8 uoluit ed. with arsa, vobit the vulgate. We have here a
good example of the consequences of neglecting to spell Latin as the
Romans spelt it. The Mss, except V which gives uouit, have
uoluit which may come either from uelle or ualerere. The edd. write
volvit, thus ecmonsce'ously altering the text. Naturally dissatislied with
this, they propose conjectures, eg. fierit, movit. naret't, evariant in V,
is better thau either; but no change is needed. 659 rara BE, ait
the rest (G over an erasure) aud edd, but the verb can be dispensed
with, 1x raa sqq. olo seu Sulpitius, sed the MSS, a very natural
mistake3 but seu not only agrees better with Lucan’s custom elsewhere
but also with the preceding aut. 693 pugnae ed, pugnae, the vulgate
punctuation, which makes the passage somewhat incoherent. As
already said (cl. 72, 121 and notes) Lucan is fond os making one noun
iu the nom. the predicate to another. With norrea populare erit
means ‘will be due to,' but with par ‘will consist in.’ 696 erit
M perh. E, errent the rest. Both are correct, but erit is clearer.
'13⁶ out Marte subactis must be corrupt, es it can only mean
‘or the conquered' as in 613,V111 144. Bentley conjectured in
M. orbatis, ‘regarding the conquered,’ and a Marte peracto has
also been suggested. subactis may have corne from peractis, in
which case 1 would read ac ior aut with V. peragere properly
is ‘to drive through’ or ‘about' so ‘to exhaust,’ cf. Sen. Ep. 58. a
‘pecora peragentem et totis saltibus dissipantem asilum,’ Ov· F. 4. 693
sq. ‘ille suam peragebat humum, siue usus aratri Ι seu curuae salcis siue
bidentis erat,’ ie. exercebat. So in Manil. 4. 593 ‘solem—peractum'
(Ellis, uass ‘proiectum '). '140 cunctis is very suspicions. Heius.
conjectured fuluis. mtilr's would give the same sense aud be somewhat
nearer to the mss. ido-'l Here again the Mss (and editors with
them) disagree fundamentally, aud the passage appears to have been
tampered with. BE read nec plura loculus, MC sic milite iassa and
omit 747. But two Mss give intermediate readings, U having nec
plura locutas but omitting 747, G se'c milite iusso hut reta'xmxxgxx.
These divergencies are iutelligible, ii orig'mally the two readings &aab
