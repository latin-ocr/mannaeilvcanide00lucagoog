The last historian of the Civil WarS, Col. Stoffel, fixes the
scene of the battle at the north· east angle of the Pharsalian
plain The river Enipeus, now called the Liltle T clrinarlz', which
flows nearly due north till it reaches the pass of Velestirw, there
turns through a right angle and pursues a westerly course,
gradually bending to the north as it gets further into the plain.
¹ On the western side of the mountain (M. K araclja Ahmet) whose
base it washes as it makes the turn, Col Stoflel places the
camp and forts (castella) of Pompey‚ and supposes the battle to
have been fought abouttwo miles to the west on the left, or south,
bank of the river. Caesar’s camp he places about two miles
further to the west in the space between the river and a rocky
point called K rindir, a projection from M. K aradaglr or the hill
immediately to the west of Pharsalus². Col. Stoffel's selection of
the ardere-plaine of Pharsalus, as the only site which satisfies the
military conditions³, rests on three identifications.
