THE BATTLE OF PllhRSALlh. xix

These indeed did not require the tohens which to pious or de-
sponding spirits conveyed the menace os divine displeasure. A
violent storm opposed the passage ol the army into Thessaly.
Day was suddenly turned into night, fire'flashed in their facee,
and tear-drops‚ as it seemed, trickled' down the still republican
eagles¹. Upon· one of the ensigns a suarm of bees settled, and*
its bearer could hardly litt from the ground the overpowcring ’
ινείςιιι9.

Seven days alter the sack oi Gomphi Caesar moving eastward
entered the Pharsalian plain, and encamping in a suit table
position awaited the Pompeian advance³. The ripening corn
promised him abundant supplies; and his troops were in thc
highest spirits and condition, 'all eagerriess to face the foe and
wipe out the shameful memory ol Dyrrhachium& Accordingly
when his antagonist, about a week later, marching southward
hom Larisa took up a strong position'on the hills to the north or

having stayed behind ill at Dyrrhachium see Plutarch Cic. 39 virias
compared with Cato min. 55 and Cic. ad Aa. ιι. 5. 3, and Cicero
himself de Diu. ι. 68, 69. Lucan’s statement that he was the mouth'
piece of the demand sor battle is a rhetorical violation os history·
without a particle ol justification, unless we draw it from the words ol
the penbcka ol Livy, ‘Cn Pompeius ad Dyrrhachium obsessus a Caesare
et, praesidiis eius cum magna clade diuersae partis expugnatis, obsidione
· liberatus, translato in Thessaliam bello, apud Pharsaliam acie uictus
est. ‘Cicero in castris remansit, uir nihil minus quam ad bella natus,’
but castris there means the camp near Dyrrhachium, as it is clear from
Cicero’s own phrase (Diu. 1. 68) he was not in Dyrrhachium itsell.
These last words on Cicero's peace-leving disposition come at least
in substance from Livy 3 and it is worth noting how Lucan twists the
same sentiment to his own purpose (65 sq.).

nexion between these three phenomena.
