HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA.

§u Τ lte credibilt'ty' os Lucan's account.

Or the battle of Pharsalia, as of most events in the civil
Wars, we have but one contemporary account-the naturally
one-sided narrative of Caesar. It is accordingly a matter of
historical importance, as well as of literary interest, to ascertain
whether the statements of Lucan may be believed. The con-
sensus of modern historians to rank him among the authorities
for the events which he describes is indeed not likely to be set
aside; but it may well be asked within what limits and with what
abatements there is historical verity in his presentation.

In the first place the character of his work must be remem-
bered. Lucan was writing a poem and not a history; and
accordingly he felt bound to employ the artifices of his

craft. Anything therefore in his account which is poetically or
rhetorically effective, and is at the same time intrinsically irn-

probable and unconfirmed by independenttestimony‚ may safely
be ascribed to the invention of the rhetorical poet. The battle
must be sudden, brought about by the clamours of the soldiery
on its very morning. The'mouthpiece of their mutinous
request must be the chief of Roman orators. ln the team.

Brutus, disguised forsooth as a common semiermes& amemus.
