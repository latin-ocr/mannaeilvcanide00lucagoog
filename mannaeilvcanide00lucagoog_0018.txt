stantial accuracy appears to have been overlooked.v He has
'committed no geographical error in placing Pholoe in Thessaly ¹,
nor any historical one in the mention ol Spanish targeteers
among the forces engaged at Pharsalia2. The inundation of the

Enipeus, to which little prominence is given in his narrative, is
confirmed by collateral and independent evidence³; and the ’

striking correctness os his account of the decisive charge of
Caesats reserve appears to warrantus in removing a corruption
which disligures a· portion of the descriptioni ’

On the other hand we might reasonably expect him to know
¹the occasion of his hero's first triumph⁵‚ and not to assign to
his favourite birds the tastes of carrion crows⁶. More than
once too he mars his own worlrmanship by a sailure to realize
'the expressions that he employs⁷.· ’

lt would appear then that, so lar at least as Lucan's account
¹of Pharsalia is concerned, the praise ol Col. Stoffel is too strong:
'‘Or Lucain merite ici toute creance3 car lorsqu'il ne s’agit que
de rapporter les saits (nous ne disons: quand il s’agit de les
juger), le poete⁴ de Cordoue se montre un historien des'plus
veriduiques' (Histoire des Juies cessar, Gue'rre Civile, vol. 11.,
p. 251). Others however have erred in the opposite directions

§a The authorities of Lucan.⁴ . ’ “

As* Lucan was no eye-witness or contemporary ol the events
which he narrates, whatever verity his narrative possessos it
must owe entirely to the sources from which it was deriied.
