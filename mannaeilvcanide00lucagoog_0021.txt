THE BATTLE OF PHARSALIA. XV

detached to oc'cupy Lissus, he proceeded up the valley of the
Aous past Jodnnina to the pass of Mltsovo and arrived at
Aeginium (Stagris) in north-west Thessaly where he was joined
some seven days· later by his lieutenant, Domitius Caluinus1,
with the army which had been operating against Scipio² in
Eastern Macedonia The country was hostile; for the news of
Dyrrhachium had spread like wildfire ; and Gomphi, which was
the first town of Thessaly they reached, and which a few
months before had placed all its resources at Caesar’s disposal‚
closed its gates against him. It was promptly stormed and
abandoned to pillage. There were large stores of wine and
provisions in the place, and the soldiery recouped themselves
for the privations of the march hya drunken carouse, in which
the German troops were the most distinguished³. From Gomphi
Caesar proceeded to Metropolis (now Paleokastro), which also
had meditated resistance; but the account which Caesar’s pri-
soners gave of the fall of Gomphi speedily opened its walls
No harm was done to the inhabitants Other towns accordingly
followed its example, and with the exception of Larisa and its
immediate neighbourhood4, Caesar was master of Thessaly. ⁴

Meanwhile Pompey, who had ceased to pursue Caesar after
his arrival in Apollonia, marched through Candauia by the Via
Egnatia into Macedonia, while Scipio, after the retirement of
Domitius southward, crossed the Cambunian mountains to
Larisa. Pompey followed him and joined him not long after
the arrival of Caesar in Thessaly.
