H F. text of this edition of Book Vll. of Lucan's Ct'vil
War is based in the main on the critical uraterials
collected in the Teubner edition of Dr C. Hosius. For the
notes the last English Commentary, that by the late Mr C. E.
Haskins‚ has of course been frequently referred to; but they
owe more to the older editions, especially those of Ouden-
dorp, Burmann, and Bentley, and to Mr W. E. Heitland's
excellent Introduction to Lucan. I have had in addition the
use of a MS. English translation and notes hy my friend and
colleague, the Rev. R. St J. Parry, Tutor and Senior Dean
of Trinity College‚ from which my commentary has derived
much advantage, direct and indirect. In preparing the
Historical Introduction, which is designed to give a picture
of the most important battle of the Civil Wars, I have
derived much assistance from the histories of Drumann, Long
and Merivale‚ and from Col. Stoffel’s military history of the
Civil Wars with its valuable maps and plans To my
friend, Dr Jas. Gow, who read this part of my book, Ι am

indebted for some useful criticisms and suggestions.
