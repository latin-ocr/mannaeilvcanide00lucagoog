rue Barrus or ruaasauin. xxxvii

Ovid Met. 1. 579 ‘irrequietus Enipeus? Valerius Flaccus agrees
with Lucan 1. 3 57 ‘segmbr Apidani uires ubi sentit Enipeus!

11. The ‘riuus quidam impeditis ripis’ of Caesar, on which
1Pompey’s right wing tested, is identified with the Enipeus.
¹This is much more doubtful· lt is true that the Enipeus has
difficult banks3 and that Frontinus as well as Lucan says
distinctly that Pompey's right wing rested on that river; and
that Appian also (l. c.) mentions the Enipeus in connexion
with the battle. But Merivale well says that to spcak oi the
principal river oi Thessaliotis as ‘riuus quidam' would be
“against Caesaffs¹ and all correct usage.’' To which Col. Stoliel
can only reply that Caesar gives the name of riuus to the
Enipeus because ‘on the day of the battle this river had no more
water in it than a brook,’ thus unconsciously contradicting two
out oi the three authorities on whorn the identification is
based².

lll. But what are we to say of the third identification?
The Pompeians made their last standon a mountain beneath
which flowed a river (‘hunc montem flumen subluebat‚' Caesar
c. 97. 4), and Col. stoffel supposes this mountain to be the eastern
height oi M. Karadja Ahmet, and this ‘river' to be thesaure
Enipeus which was a ‘brook' in c. 88, and whose course up the
vallcy Caesar, according to Col. Stoflel's map, had been following
all the time, being never hall a mile away from its banks!

As Col. Stofiel's theory must be rejected, and as strategical
reasons imperatively forbid the assumption oi a site in the open,
south os the little Tchinarlz} it only remains to suppose that
Pompey's camp was somewhere on the range os hills to the
North oi the plain, and that the battle was thus iought between
them and the river. ll 1 do not mistake‚ these hills were not
examined sor a site by Col. Stoffel, who speaks only os the

southern range, p. 242. Such a position would agree well with
the facts that Pompey entered the camp froin the field of battle
