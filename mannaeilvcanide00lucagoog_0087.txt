the current account, that they settled on the altar 11σῷ δὲ τῷ Πομπηίῳ
τῆς αὐτῆς νυκτός τινα τῶν lepelur ori συνελήφθη rai μελισσῶν ἐσμὸς ἐπὶ
respondentem, ζῴου νωλεχσΰς.

161. 11111111 ‘bowed down with the unusual (or overpowering)
weight.' The abl. in ῖ in comparative stems is extremely rare and,
excepting priori Or. Met. 8. 443 (a doubtful case), is not iound in

the best peiiod.¹ The other example in Lucan is priori lx 996.
As is well known, itis usually the tonus os the consonantal stcms that
supplant tlrose ot' the istems, not vice versa.

163. 11111111 ‘caused to slnk,’ ‘bowed down'; ci. Sil. 11. 11. 78 sq.
(oi a dog snuffing along the ground) ‘erroresque serae sollers per deuia
mersa Ι nare legit.' rorantia nota. Statues are said to have
wept, eg. at Julius Caesar’s sate, Virg. G. 1. 481, Ov. Mel. ¹5· 791
and before Cannae, Sil. 11. 8. 645, but ensigns perhaps only here.
Some sort ot' personality seems to have been attributed to them, as
Pliny tells us that the ‘aquilae ac signa' were anointed with perlumes on
least days, adding sarcastically ‘ita est nimirum hac mercede corruptae
orbem terranrm deuicere aquilae) Propertius 4 (5). r. 96 ‘concidit
ante aquilae rostra crrrmta suae' perhaps intends to suggest a similar
idea.

164. nubttoa ‘of the state.' After Pharsalia they were Caesar's,
i.e. prr'uata3 cs. 11 319 sq. ‘quin publica signo ducemque Ι Pompeium
sequimuri' ib. 531 sq. ‘o uere Romana manus, quibus arma senatus Ι
non priuata dedit!

165. admotus superte ‘brought into the presenoe ol the gods’

1111111111. The altar would be ot' turi or stones.
166. 11111111118711. The ‘iuga uictimarumtis mentioned also

by Val. Max„ Florus, Appian ll.c. above. praeceps, adverb.
praecpitem would be more usual iu prose.

167. 1111111111, as the army was doomed.

168. scelerum superos ‘gods that prompt to crimes’; cs. 11 81
‘terribilesque deos scelerum‚’ eg. Mars, one oi whose attendants is
‘caecum Nefas,’ stae Th. 7. 48.

171. Notae personified, asin vr 695 and Stat. supr. ‘Fas’ was
addressed by the letlals in declaring war, Livy 1. 32. 6. Similar
personified abstractions abouuded in the Roman pantheon. So
