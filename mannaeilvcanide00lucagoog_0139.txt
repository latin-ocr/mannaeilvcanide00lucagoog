nloscere) are matter of doubt3 (4) that there is hopeless disagreement
· about the endos the line. There are tour words, uultus, tempus, possm,
quaerunt competing lor two places. quaerunt is now rejected by all,
and rightly so: it is clearly an attempt to provide a governing verb for
the infinitive. tempus again, as Dr Hosius and Mr Heitland agree, is
undoubtedly genuine. Of the two words lelt, possent may well have
been interpolated, for the same reason as quaerunt, while uultur does
not appear to be due to agnoscere, as it occurs in P. uultus again gives
a touch which Lucan is not likely to have omitted (cl. 322, tv 170). 1
think then the variants are best explained by the hypothesis that the
end ol 462 was injured in the archetype and its last word tenpus was
written in again in a place where it might be thought to refer to uultus,
one scribe accordinglytaking uultus and another tenepusfrom the supposed
altematives and each filling up the line according to his fancy, the
difficulty ol the real construction ‘noscere uoltus ac (noscere) quae
monstra facturi forent’ (cf. 375 n.) preventing thern from seeing the truth.
As ere is written Q. in early mss, ·que agnoscere and quo noscere
could easily corne from Q.Acnoscr:urt (ac noscere which Oudendorp
conjectured). The resulting reading will be inde manum spectant ;
uultusque ac noscere tempus. The disagreement about the order of
the lines may mean that one of them (which must be 463, where too it
may be observed that aut is not correctly used) is spurious. Then we
shall read and punctuate inde monus spectant uultusque, ac noscere
