sels was not spared: his inaction was vehemently attached and
his vanity openly derided. How long was this Agamemnon, this
‘king of kings'1, to drag his vassal princes and a submissive
senate athis heels? Procrastination now was not prudence; it
was mere cowardice, lust of authority, or worse lt the general
would not fight, the soldiers would. Weary ol clamour and
apprehensive ol the consequences of further delay, Pompey
summoned a council of war, announced that he would offer battle
on the morrow, and unfolded his planl. lt was simplicity itsell.
Belore the infantry closed, before a single missile had been
discharged on the enemy, the cavalry were to be precipitated
upon their unguarded flank, and Caesar's army would be routed.
‘l have communicated this plan,' he said, ‘to our cavalry and
they have agr'eed to carry it out³.' He was followed by Labienus,
once Caesars most trusted officer in the Gallie campaigns, who
declared that Caesaffs soldiers were not the formidable victors
of Gaul and Germany,nearly all of whom had perished in battle
or by disease, but recent levies from Gallia Citerior, and, for the
most part, from the colonies beyond the Padus. He concluded
by taking an oath that he would not return to the camp until the
victory was won and bidding the rest do liltewise. Pompey
applauded and swore the same, as did all the other leaders
present The sequel will show how these oaths were kept.

¹ So L. Domitius called him. Plutarch Pomp. 67, Caes. 41, Appian
c. 67. The stupid Dio took ‘Agamemnon’ to be a compliment (42. 5).

² Plutarch Pomp. 68 represents this council as taking place the day
before the battle ς Caesar c. 86. 1 has the indefinite expression, ‘superio
ribus diebus,’ ‘on a previous day‚’ which however must be interpreted by
the light ot ‘in posterum diem' in ἓ 5, so that there is no contradiction
between Caesar and Plutarch, as Col. Stoffel imagines, vol. 11. p. 240.

⁸ ‘Persuasi equitibus nostris idque mihi facturos confirmauerunt ut,
cum propius sit accessum, dextrum Caesaris cornu ab latere aperto
adgrederentur et circumuenta acie pn'us perturbatum exercitum pellerent
quam a nobis telum in hostem iaceretur,' Caes. c. 86. Incident and

expression (persuasi) alilte throw a vivid light on the weahness ot
Pompey’s authority.
