171 ‘nec se Roma fereus’=et R. se une-serens) nor in diu which he
defends by v111 671 sq. ‘nodosaque frangitl ossa diu? With uertens
however, which indicates an essentially momentary action, this adverb is
uot appropriate3 and a comparison oi 111 337 sq. ‘non pondera rerum!
uec momenta sumus,’ suggests that rerum rot pondera should teser to
what was ot importance in deciding the issues 11 stake. Some con·
jectures are given in the crit. App.-

505. rato torrento. The metaphor is apparently from a river in
flood. The sole difference between fortune and fate in this and other
places of Lucan appears to be that indicated by the capital letter. Cf.
88 sq., ²05 sq, 111 39²» v111 11 sqq.

506. Lucan apparently misled by the fact that there were a lew
horse on the right wing (Frontinus quoted on 114) wrongly regards
both Pompeian wings as participating in the outflanking movement
which was to turn the battle. See Caesar's account c. 88 fin. ‘dextrum
comu eius (Pompey) riuus quidam impeditis ripis muniebat: quam ob
caussam cunctum equitatum sagittantes funditoresque omnes in sinistro
cornu obiecerat! For diduxtt cornua, ‘drew the wings in different
directions,' compare Livy-28. 14. 15 and 17 ‘nuntium (Scipio) ad
Silanum et Marcium misit ut cornu extenderentur sinistram partem
quemadmodum se tendentem ad dexteram uidissent—ita diductis cer-
nibus'ete. =
507. belli, cf. 111, 651 n. ultima, Caesar's extreme right
and lest. =
508. sparsa, of the iree order of light armed. per extremos
...maniploa ie. over Pompey’s extreme lest and right.

509. menuitur, ci. Caesar c. 93 ‘eodem tempore equites ab
sinistro Pompei cornu, ut erat imperatum, universi procucurrerunt omnis·
qne multitudo sagittariorum se profudit, quorum impetum noster equi·
tatus non tulit, sed paullum loco motus cessit, equitesque Pompeiani hoc
acrius instare et se turmatim explicare aciemque nostram a latere aperto
circumire coeperunt) saeuas ‘bloodthirsty bands‚’ see Crit. App·

511. noes. These, like the saxa, would be hurled from ballistae, cf.
11 686 sq. ftortaque per tenebras validis ballista lacertis Ι multifidas
iaculata faces.’ But it is not clear what they are doing here where there
are no ships or buildings to fire. lt looks as it Virgil Aen. 1. 15⁰
‘iamque faces et saxa uolant,’ were being copied without reflection. In
Val. Fl. 3. 96 ‘saxa facesque atras et tortae pondero lundon* axe uae
weapons ot‘ a mob. «- · ’
