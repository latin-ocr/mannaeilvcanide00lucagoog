memory; 3ηά facts are hard to hide. The eagcrness of the
Caesarians for battle sorts but ill with the length and elaborate·
ness of their leader’s speech ; and when in book vul the flying
hero trembles at every rustle of'the forest, we know what to
think of the majestic calm, with which in book v11 he sustains
defeat.

ς lt must not howeverbe supposed that if a narrative of Lucan
¹cannot be accepted as it standS, it is therefore destitute of all
foundation. Exaggeration, suppression and distortion are in
general easier modes of perverting than sheer fabrication; anda
close and critical examination may sometimes discover, even in
the wildest improbabilities, the vestiges of truth. For example,
the command of Caesar for the destruction of his camp seems at
first sight to be as wholly fictitious as it is utterly incredible;
but nevertheless it appears to be based on a real incident, and
perhaps on a real orderl. The pause before the battle was a
fact; but to understand its nature and circumstances we must
discard the high-flown narrative of Lucane

Even iu the absence of all temptation to misstatement the
accuracy of Lucan cannot be relied upon. Iu every branch of
learning, history, geography, mythology, and science as it was
then understood, he was the possessor of vast stores of multi·
faribus information. But this learning was undigested and
inexact ; and his sels-confidence led him into error at every

For some of his mistalres it is true he is not himself
primarily responsible. The confusion of the two great battle·
fields, the bullets that melt in their course, the hemorrhage that
forces the weapon from the wound³: all of these he had found
in the writings of his predecessors⁴. ln other cases his sub-
