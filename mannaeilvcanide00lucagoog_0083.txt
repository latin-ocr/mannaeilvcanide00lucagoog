aerium niuei montis liquere cacumen'3 Hor. Serm. r. 3. 9sqq. ‘saepe
uelut qui Ι currebat fugiens hostem, persaepe uelut qui Ι lunonis sacra
ferret! So in Pind. Nem. 8. 40 sqq. αὔξεται δ’ ἀρετὰ χλωραῖς ἐέρσαις dr
dre δένδρεον ᾄσσει Ι ἐν σοφοῖς ἀνδρῶν ἀερθεῖσ’ ἐν δικαίοις το Ι πρὸς

ὑγρὸν αἰθέρα The last words belong to the tree, just as in ib. 6.
64 sq. ὃιλφΜ κεν τάχος δι’ ἅλμας Ι tocsano (so we should medicor
εἴτοιριι codd.) Μελησίαν, δι’ ἅλμας belongs only to the dolphin.

126. det retinen, i.e. lets the winds steer. igneum
‘inactive' exph’by arte renota ‘abandoning his crau’ or ‘profession’
here the ars grrbnnandr' (Cic, Quintil.) or navigation. So iners
is properly a man who has no profession.

¹²7· onus, he is mere ‘sreight'3 onus (cf. onero, oneraria) is a
regular word sor ‘cargo’

128. animi moes ‘even bold spirits'; animus the heart‘s action,
cs.1v ²85 sqq. ‘saucia maiores animos ut pectora gestant Ι dum dolor est
ictusque recens’ (cf. 290), ie. ‘there is more vitality in the heart.’ lt
could hardly mean the hearts themselves. For the strong emphasis on
truces ct. notes on ομ, ο8ο, 711, 760. pulsent. Cf. Il. ο. 716
θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι πάτασσε.

ιο9. incertis, ‘irregular‚' a bad sign. H. quotes Aesch. Ag. 995-

4644 and the idea is common elsewhere. Cf. Macaulay, Hirr. os
England ch. v,.0n Monmouth before Sedgmoor ‘The very children who

was sad and full of evil augury.’ The last words mean ‘their appearance
is that of doomed men' On uenturaest see Crit. App.

ι 32· conderet ‘stablish,‘ ie. determine ‘destiny’ as in Virg. Aen.
ιο. 35 ‘nona condere fala,’ Val. Fl. ι. 531 ‘uetera haec nobis et condita
pergunt Ι ordine cuncta suo) The imperfect in sequence is due to
palam eet being a historical present and so able to take the con·
struction of its sense (past) as well as os its tense (present), see Ν. L. P.
229, 389 (b), cf. 464, 638. quaeri with illo Marte ‘the issue to be
determined is,’ cf. Livy 2. 57. 3 ‘magis quorum in manu sit (res
publica) quarn ut incolumis sit quaeri! For the order cf. 33 ιι.

quid esset ‘what it is to be,' i.e. whether eregnum or alibero
ciuitas. The imperf. indicates a time future to that of conderet. Τ he

‘quid sutura esset' (Ν. L. P. ‘tergm bnt not adunus„ etcum n. gg. n.
